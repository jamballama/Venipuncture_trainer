Use 1 Part A and 1 Part B for any Silicon Part or follow instructions of supplier.

To make platinumcured Silicon conductable, use 0.5 % (mass) of the total silicon in carbon flakes.
First soak them in ethanol/ isopropanol.
Then seperate the fibers using a urine syringe. Suck up the ethanol and squeeze it under high pressure at the flakes until left with a black cotton-like substance.
Extract it and let it dry. 

Then add it to the Silicone. Mix thouroughly. Using to much will negatively affect the curing process.
